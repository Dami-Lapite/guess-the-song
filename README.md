# Guess The Song

### Inspired by https://github.com/adam-goodrich/MP3_Game and my friend Dhyey

After selecting a desktop folder containing .mp3 files, a short snippet of a random song is played.<br/>
The user can choose to listen to a longer snippet, see the answer or quit the round.<br/>
The user can then choose to play another round.<br/>
